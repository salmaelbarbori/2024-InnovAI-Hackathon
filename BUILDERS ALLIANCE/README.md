##  Background and Problem Statement: 💢

Salma and Zineb are planning to visit 5 Moroccan cities during their 1-week vacation ⏳, but the real challenge is the planning process. They’ve learned that **for every week of travel**, they need **3 weeks of planing**, from **finding the best spots to visit to understanding transportation options** ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🍃˚.⛰️⋆☁️. Yet, they only speak **DARIJA**, which makes it hard for them to search in foreign languages. They tried **consulting a guide**, but it was **5 times more expensive than expected** and felt too **general**. This issue is holding them back 😟, and it’s affecting Morocco’s **tourism sector** 📉, which **contributes 7% of GDP**. 

Do we really need weeks of prep for just 1 week of travel? And do we need to speak foreign languages to travel in our own country ⁉️


##  Impact and Proposed Solution: 💡

Terhal is a chatbot 🤖 powered by LLMs (GPT-4 and Terjman), featuring an easy-to-use interface designed for Moroccan travelers passionate about using **DARIJA** while searching for the best places to visit in Morocco. It represents a brand-new way to help travelers find the best spots without investing too much time in preparation (time is money 💰). Not only that, it breaks down language barriers by incorporating the casual dialect **DARIJA** into the search. While built on existing solutions, Terhal combines the trio of **cost, quality, and time**, offering Moroccan travelers personalized recommendations in under 10 minutes, all in their mother tongue.

##  Project Outcomes and Deliverables: 🎯

- **Finding the best spots** to visit in each city in Morocco.
- **Time reduction** in planning, cutting trip preparation from 3 weeks to just 10 minutes.
- **Personalized recommendations** to find the best places for each traveler's needs.
- **Moroccan Dialect Support**, Terhal is tailored for Moroccan travelers and can understand and interact with over 90% accuracy in DARIJA.
- **Simple Interfac**, The interaction with Terhal is through Terhal Bot, a beginner-friendly user interface with simple components to enhance accessibility for all users.
